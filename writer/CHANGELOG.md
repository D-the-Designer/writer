# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added Claude as a first-class provider through Anthropic's Messages API, with
  Sonnet 5 as the recommended quality route plus Fable, Opus, Sonnet 4.6, and
  Haiku options. Claude keys remain session-only unless browser storage is
  explicitly enabled.
- Fixed sidecar chat context so long manuscripts and lore files are reduced to
  relevant excerpts instead of being sent whole, preventing provider request
  size and rate-limit failures.
- Added AI Horde as a first-class free community-cloud fiction provider with
  anonymous access, optional registered keys, live model discovery, trusted
  worker routing, and asynchronous queue polling.
- Added Bring Your Own API connections for multiple OpenAI-compatible
  chat-completions providers. Keys remain separate from project data, exports,
  prompts, revisions, and privacy receipts.
- Replaced the tall floating Rewrite dropdown with an expanding toolbar tray
  that pushes the manuscript down instead of covering the text.
- Added a controlled Company Man house voice derived from Chapters 1–5, with
  explicit repetition limits and a trust-the-image editorial rule.
- Existing DOCX, TXT, RTF, and Markdown files now open under an explicit
  `— Writer Copy` name, with numbered collision handling and visible
  source-protection status.
- Added ten built-in Rewrite tones for fiction: Warm, Dry, Playful, Tense,
  Ominous, Gritty, Intimate, Sensual, Romantic, and Cinematic.
- Added Rewrite intensity controls for Cleaner, Filthier, Harsher, More violent,
  and Less violent while preserving established events and boundaries.
- Added Rewrite voice presets for gonzo/Rolling Stone journalism, 1970s film
  novelizations, pulp novels, and Val Renberg's dry engineer voice from
  *Wanderer*.
- Added Plot Improv for generating eight lore-aware, causally plausible next
  moves without changing the manuscript before acceptance.
- Added the Davenport knowledge-manifest schema and a dependency-free validator
  for production bibles, guides, lore indexes, manuscripts, and style sources.
- Kept Davenport workflow state independent from story canon status and added
  explicit AI-use policies for retrieval, training, reference-only, and blocked
  material.
